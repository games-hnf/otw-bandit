# OverTheWire: Bandit Walkthrough
**üêò 47Guardian**

This repository contains my personal writeups and solutions for all levels of the [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) on *OverTheWire*.

Each level has its own directory, containing:
- **README.md**: my personal notes, learning process, and commands used.
- **solution.sh**: the exact commands/scripts that solved the level.

Found passwords are stored locally in **.pass** (gitignored).
